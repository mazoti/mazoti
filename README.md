I'm a software engineering specialist and also have a computer science degree, both from the best universities of Brazil. I've been working with software development on embedded, web and desktop systems since 2010 at small, medium, global and startup companies in-office and remote positions. Feel free to contact me, it would be a pleasure to help!
